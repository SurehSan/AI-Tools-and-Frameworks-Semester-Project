# AI-Tools-and-Frameworks-Semester-Project
Simple finetuning of EfficientNetV2B0 to be able to classify Simpsons characters.

## What is this project?
- This project was the end result of my Artificial Intelligence Tools and Frameworks Class (CSC478) I took for my second semester for my second year at Dakota State University.
- Our objective was to train a model to be able to classify cartoon characters (specifically The Simpsons) to obtain the best F1, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Loss scores possible.

## What was the result?
- Our model reached extremely good training and validation scores as shown below.

- Additionally, our model reached a testing F1 and Accuracy score of more than 0.96 on the final test.
